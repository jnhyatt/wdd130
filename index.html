            My name is Josh Hyatt. I've been doing software development for about 12 years and I
            love to make games! I follow aerospace news pretty closely and I love to watch rockets
            launch ðŸš€

            I'm from Utah where the air is dry and thin. Utah is home to several national parks and
            there's plenty to do if you love being outside. The Salt Lake Valley is a busy and
            rapidly-growing collection of cities and suburbs, but further from this epicenter you
            can find vast swaths of farmland. Utah exports a wide variety of agricultural products
            and is named the Beehive State after one of its core values &ndash; industry.
